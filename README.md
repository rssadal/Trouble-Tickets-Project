# Trouble-Tickets-Project

Project for the 2023 edition of the Web Languages and Technologies course.

# Objective
Develop a website to streamline and manage trouble tickets effectively. The system should enable users to submit, track, and resolve tickets promptly and efficiently. Additionally, the website should have intuitive user interfaces and reporting functionalities to provide real-time insights into ticket status and performance metrics.

To create this website, we:

 - Create an SQLite database that stores information about users, tickets, departments, hashtags, and frequently asked questions (FAQ).
 - Create documents using HTML and CSS representing the application's web pages.
 - Use PHP to generate those web pages after retrieving/changing data from the database.
 - Use Javascript to enhance the user experience (for example, using Ajax).
